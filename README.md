# IT security summary
## Reasons for IT security
Security is becoming a massive industry within IT. As the capabilities of computers and networking grows, many more vulnerabilities are introduced. Security vulnarabilities could mean massive costs and in some cases can mean the end of a business. At this moment even governments have become vulnerable. We need to keep an eye on security to keep the IT industry healthy and safe.

### Loss of data
Loss of data could mean immense consequences. Imagine a bank losing records of all their mortgages, how would they be able to prove who their customers are? Imagine a government losing access to all personal identification information. How could you prove someone isn't a citizen of the country and how do you keep track of people under protected identity? You can see that IT security is something that is incredibly important to every person, government and industry.

# Information security as a process
Instead of seeing security as some sort of band-aid, where something went wrong and has already cause some sort of damage. Organisations are starting to implement security as a process. 

# Security vs. convenience
Having no security is very convenient for daily life. Not having to lock your car, entering your house without a key, starting up your computer without a password etc. For these conveniences, you'd have to trade security. You could see it as a scale where security is on one side and convenience is on the other.

It could be that security is too heavily implement. It would be inconvenient if it would take ten minutes to receive money from an ATM, because an employee of the bank would have to identify you through the ATM camera for instance.

**Some things require more security than others**

## Confidentiality
**Limiting access ot information.**

Access by rights or roles. Encryption or locked access can ensure confidentiality.

## Integrity
**Guaranteeing that information is not changed without consent or knowledge**

Measurements could be redundant storage (RAID), backups, checksums, storing data on read-only storage mediums, logging / version history.

## Availability
**Data should be available when it is needed.**

Failover (reduntant nodes in the data infrastructure),Load-balancing, disaster recovery.

# Components of Information Security

## Primitives
***"Cryptographic primitives"*** 
Basic concepts of cryptography based on mathmetics

"Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin." ~ John von Neuman

### Entropy
The randomness collected by a operating system or application

## Encryption
Symetric encryption is by definition not less secure than asymmetric encryption. The security depends more key management than which technique is used.
### Substitution
The greek scytatale, ceasar cypher
### Transformation
Enigma machine
### Symetric
One key for both party, which is convenient and not complicated. Hard to keep the key safe.
### Asymetric
Two keys, one for encrypting and one for decrypting. More complicated but more secure.

### DES - Data Encryption Standard

### AES - Advanced Encryption Standard
Current standard for symmetric block encryption.

Three key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits respectively.

Iterations: 10, 12 or 14

One key is the private key and the other key is the public key.
### Block

### Stream

## Policies
Internal and external rules for organisations.

Laws, certifications, "common sense", company policy.

## Products
Implementations of Primivites and Policies. Software hardware and behaviour.

End goal is a safer organisation.
